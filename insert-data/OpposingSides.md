"Opposing Sides" tells a story of balance and tension. The mirrored circle visually represents the opposing nature of urban growth and deforestation. The piece serves as a reminder that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. 

The urban population data is represented on one side and the deforestation data on the other, highlighting the tension between these two issues. It's arranged in a circular pattern, creating a sense of balance and symmetry that contrasts with the opposing nature of the data. The use of a dark background helps to highlight a sense of depth.
