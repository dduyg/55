Inspired by the concept of duality and the intriguing patterns that emerge when contrasting data sets are juxtaposed. 

The data for this project was sourced from two contrasting datasets: one representing urban population growth and the other representing deforestation rates. These datasets were chosen to highlight the tension between urban development and environmental preservation. The tools used in this project include Python for data manipulation, D3.js for creating the visualizations.

The first step in the process was data collection and cleaning. The next step was data analysis, where I explored the data to understand the patterns and relationships. This was followed by data transformation, where I manipulated the data to fit the concept of the art piece.

The urban population data is represented on one side and the deforestation data on the other, creating a visual tension that mirrors the real-world tension between these two issues.
The bars are arranged in a circular pattern, creating a sense of balance and symmetry that contrasts with the opposing nature of the data. The use of a dark background helps to highlight a sense of depth.

"Opposing Sides" tells a story of balance and tension. The mirrored circle visually represents the opposing nature of urban growth and deforestation, highlighting the need for balance in our approach to development and environmental preservation. 

The piece serves as a reminder that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, a concept that is as true in data as it is in physics.
