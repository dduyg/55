To give you a flavor of the game/ Here is some code that illustrates how we read values from the line sensors:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":

    folder_path = "/path/to/your/image/folder"

    num_colors = 2  # Change this value to extract a different number of colors

    process_images_in_folder(folder_path, num_colors)
```
