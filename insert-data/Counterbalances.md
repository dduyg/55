*Counterbalances* is a work that showcases a surprising sense of balance as different shapes move and interact with each other. The concept for this work originated from my curiosity to examine the balance and harmony that can be found between various shapes. To create this work, motion capture data was used as a starting point, providing the initial movements, positions, sizes, and interactions of the shapes. 

Through an iterative design process, the shapes were adjusted to move in certain patterns, allowing for an exploration of how they could interact with each other to produce a visually stunning balance among the various shapes. The resulting work is a series of snapshots that captures the shapes in motion.
