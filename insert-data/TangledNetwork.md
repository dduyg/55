*Tangled Network* is based on the idea of finding beauty in complexity. The work consists of a series of interconnected lines, intersecting in an intricate and seemingly random pattern. The lines vary in thickness and color, which creates a sense of depth and movement within the work. Despite its chaotic appearance, Tangled Network is actually the result of delicately created lines according to a set of rules. This interplay between randomness and structure draws inspiration from the ancient Japanese woodworking technique of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumiko_(woodworking)" class="lined">kumiko</a>, renowned for its intricate and complex patterns.
