In our bustling world, where cities and human-built infrastructure seem to dominate the landscape, it might come as a surprise to learn that no more than 1% of the world's habitable land is occupied by these infrastructures. That includes everything from our big cities, roads, towns, to the villages we call home, along with all other human settlements. Conversely, a significant 50% of the worldâ€™s habitable land is dedicated to agriculture, playing a pivotal role in shaping our planet's landscape.

Yes, you read that right - we use half of the earth's habitable land just to feed ourselves. Can you believe that to feed the human population, we use 50 times more land than we do to actually live on? This unequal distribution of land use between human infrastructure and consumption is both fascinating and alarming. 

## It hasn't always been this way.

Looking back at human history, it's clear that our planet's land was once dominated by wilderness, forests, and grasslands. But in recent centuries this has changed dramatically.

We have fundamentally transformed the landscape of our planet by expanding agricultural land to meet the growing demands of human consumption. As a result, agriculture has become one of the largest human impacts on the planet's landscape. In fact, some experts stated that the expansion of agriculture has been the biggest contributor to global environmental change. It leaves us to take a moment to think about the vast amount of land required to sustain our way of life.
