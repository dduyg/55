Turkey is no stranger to earthquakes. The country has had many earthquakes. This list
includes any notable historical earthquakes that have epicenters within the current
boundaries of Turkey, or which caused significant effects in this area. Overall, the
population in major cities like Istanbul resides in structures that are a mix of vulnerable and earthquake resistant construction.
