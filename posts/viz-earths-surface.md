summary: Visualizing how the world’s land is used.
---

In our bustling world, where cities and human-built infrastructure seem to dominate the landscape, it might come as a surprise to learn that no more than 1% of the world's habitable land is occupied by these infrastructures. That includes everything from our big cities, roads, towns, to the villages we call home, along with all other human settlements. Conversely, a significant 50% of the world’s habitable land is dedicated to agriculture, playing a pivotal role in transforming our planet's landscape.

Yes, you read that right - we use half of the earth's habitable land solely to feed ourselves. Isn't it remarkable that we use much more land to nourish ourselves than we do to build our homes and communities? This glaring disparity between land allocated to human infrastructure and human consumption is both fascinating and alarming, painting a vivid picture of a profound transformation of our landscape over the centuries due to human activities.

## It hasn't always been this way.

Looking back at human history, it’s clear that our world's landscape was once dominated by vast wilderness, lush forests, and sprawling grasslands. However, in recent centuries, this has changed dramatically. Vast swaths of natural ecosystems were cleared to make way for agricultural purposes, leading to dominance in the world's land use. By expanding agricultural land to meet the needs of a growing population, we have fundamentally altered the landscape of our planet.

### Declining natural habitat land share over time

The transformation of once-wild landscapes into land devoted to keeping pace with growing consumption patterns has emerged as one of the significant human-induced impacts on the health of our planet, affecting not only the environment but also biodiversity and climate patterns. As we find ourselves grappling with the environmental repercussions of our reliance, it leaves us to take a moment to think about the vast amount of land required to sustain our way of life. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, humans inevitably compete for limited space with numerous wild species as our planet becomes more densely populated.

### The world population has increased rapidly over the decades.

The world's population is projected to continue growing, putting even greater pressure on our finite resources. Balancing the need for food production with responsible land management and environmental stewardship is paramount.
