I this project, I want to use data to support my observation during my first six months in the U.S, that the milk tea in New York City is much, much, more expensive than it in Beijing.

So, I manually scrape 144 drinks from three milk tea shops I mentioned above in Beijing, and scrape 292 drinks from five milk tea shops that I visited in New York. I extract the base drinks, toppings and fruit types of all 436 drinks, as well as their prices.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
