It may come as a surprise, but no more than 1% of the world's habitable land is occupied by human-built infrastructure. That means all of our bustling cities, roads, towns and villages we call home, and all other human settlements combined. While agriculture takes up a whopping 50% of the world's habitable land.

Yes, you read that right - we use half of the earth's habitable land just to feed ourselves. Can you believe that to feed the human population, we use 50 times more land than we do to actually live on? This unequal distribution of land use between human infrastructure and consumption is both fascinating and alarming.

However, it hasn't always been this way. Looking back at human history, it's clear that our planet's land was once dominated by wilderness, forests, and grasslands. But in recent centuries this has changed dramaticallyâ€”we have fundamentally transformed the landscape of our planet by expanding agricultural land to meet the growing demands of human consumption.

In the visualization we see the distribution of global land area today, showing us how agriculture has become one of the largest human impacts on the planet's landscape. In fact, some experts stated that the expansion of agriculture has been the biggest contributor to global environmental change. It leaves us to take a moment to think about the vast amount of land required to sustain our way of life.
