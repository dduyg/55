"Tangled Network" explores the idea of finding beauty in complexity. The work consists of a series of interconnected lines, intersecting in an intricate and seemingly random pattern. The lines vary in thickness and color, which creates a sense of depth and movement within the work. Despite its chaotic appearance, Tangled Network is actually the result of carefully generated lines according to a set of rules. This interplay between randomness and structure draws inspiration from the ancient Japanese woodworking technique of kumiko, renowned for its intricate and complex patterns.
