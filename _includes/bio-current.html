           Well, a bit more about me. I love turning things into datasets, the programming language Python, geometric shapes, the satisfying feeling after cleaning up messy data, and a fascination with pixels and patterns. This means that I not only love generating things out of pixels and patterns but also finding hidden patterns in everyday things. <i class="grey search icon"></i>

           I'm a curious and analytical person at heart, who was born and raised in The Hague <i class="fitted grey home icon"></i>, Netherlands. As a habit, I tend to see structure in everything, and my enduring interest in numbers and patterns ultimately drove me to pursue a Data Science degree (<i class="grey university icon"></i><i>Master of Science in Data Science, @Tilburg University</i>). There's just something so satisfying about digging into a dataset and finding patterns and connections that make the data come to life and unlock new possibilities.

           I like to flip things around to see situations from different perspectives. <i class="grey eye icon"></i> All knowledge is connected in some way, and the fun is in discovering those connections. I'm all about that aha moment when seemingly unrelated pieces of information suddenly click together. <i class="grey puzzle piece icon"></i> It's like everything's a giant web, and connecting those dots is a never-ending source of inspiration. That's why I find exploring and stumbling upon new ideas by connecting seemingly unrelated bits of information so energizing. Drawing inspiration from adjacent or even unrelated fields and concepts can seriously enrich your work in unexpected ways.

           When I'm not knee-deep in data and code, you'll occasionally find me appreciating well-crafted characters and plot twists while watching K-dramas or creating digital art, especially glitch art and digital collage art. It might be interesting to know that nearly every image used on this website is my own creation.
