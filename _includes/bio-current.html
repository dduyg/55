        I was born and raised in The Hague <i style="color: #458588;" class="home icon"></i>, Netherlands. I'm a curious and analytical person at heart, and see structure in everything as a habit. I have always been interested in numbers and patterns, which led me to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree Data Science in the first place (<i style="color: #458588;" class="university icon"></i>Master of Science, Tilburg University). There's just something so satisfying about digging into a dataset and finding valuable and interesting information that lie within data.

         Besides puzzling with data and code, I also enjoy creating digital art. Especially glitch art and digital collage art. Did you know that even most of the images used on this website are my own creations?
