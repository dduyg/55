           Well, a bit more about me. I love turning things into datasets, the programming language Python, geometric shapes, the satisfying feeling after cleaning up messy data, and a fascination with pixels and patterns. This means that I not only love generating things out of pixels and patterns but also finding hidden patterns in everyday things.

           I'm a curious and analytical person at heart, who was born and raised in The Hague<i class="grey home icon"></i>, a prominent city of the Netherlands. I tend to see structure in everything as a habit. I have always been interested in numbers and patterns, which led me to pursue a Data Science degree in the first place (<i class="grey university icon"></i><i>Master of Science in Data Science, @Tilburg University</i>). There's just something so satisfying about digging into a dataset and finding patterns and connections that make the data come to life and unlock new possibilities.

         Besides puzzling with data and code, I also enjoy creating digital art. Especially glitch art and digital collage art. Did you know that even most of the images used on this website are my own creations?
