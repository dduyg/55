         <b>So, a little more about me.</b> I love turning things into datasets, the programming language Python, watching kdramas, geometric shapes, and the satisfying feeling after cleaning messy data. I was born and raised in The Hague <i class="grey home icon"></i>, Netherlands. I'm a curious and analytical person at heart, and see structure in everything as a habit.

         I have always been interested in numbers and patterns, which led me to pursue a Data Science degree in the first place (<i class="grey university icon"></i><i>Master of Science in Data Science, @Tilburg University</i>). There's just something so satisfying about digging into a dataset and finding patterns and connections that others might miss.

         Besides puzzling with data and code, I also enjoy creating digital art. Especially glitch art and digital collage art. Did you know that even most of the images used on this website are my own creations?
