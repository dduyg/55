        <p>Insert Data is an extention of my independent data design practice. Based in The Hague, NL and work with people all over the vast internet. It started when I was experimenting new ways to creatively visualize data. I found that I could create intricate designs and patterns that were not only pleasing to the eye but also held meaningful data. As I delved deeper into my experimentation with different datasets and programming tools, I started creating various pieces that I couldn't wait to share with the world.</p>

      </div>
      <p>I now create a wide range of data design and generative art pieces, from abstract designs to more detailed pieces that depict specific datasets. Each piece is unique, and I put my heart and soul into selecting the right data and techniques to create the perfect visual representation of that data. I like pushing the boundaries of what is possible with data and art, and I am always looking for new ways to create beautiful and meaningful pieces.</p>
