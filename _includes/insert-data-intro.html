         <p>Insert Data is where my love for data, programming and art collide. It started when I was experimenting new ways to creatively visualize data. I found that I could create intricate designs and patterns that were not only pleasing to the eye but also held meaningful data. As I delved deeper into my experimentation with different data sets and programming tools, I started creating various pieces that I couldn't wait to share with the world. The positive reactions I received from friends and strangers keeps me motivated.</p>

    <div class="column">
      <p>I now create a wide range of data art and generative art pieces, from abstract designs to more detailed pieces that depict specific data sets. Each piece is unique, and I put my heart and soul into selecting the right data and techniques to create the perfect visual representation of that data. I like pushing the boundaries of what is possible with data and art, and I am always looking for new ways to create beautiful and meaningful pieces.</p>
      <p>If you're looking to add a touch of wonder to your space, or would like to commission a custom piece, don't hesitate to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.contact-url }}" class="lined">contact</a> me. Thank you for joining me on this journey of turning data into art.</p>
