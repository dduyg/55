      My name is Duygu and I love finding valuable and interesting information that lie within data. With experience in various data analysis and machine learning techniques, I am able to bring new ideas to life through data and code.

      I created this website to share the things I'm working on. As someone with a curious nature, I often find myself exploring a wide range of topics, trying to make unexpected connections to gain new insights. My blog <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/en/posts/" class="lined">posts</a> reflect this, showcasing a diverse range of topics from serious to quirky. The posts can be easily filtered by project, tool/technique used (e.g. Python, Sentiment Analysis), or topic.

     For data to become information, data needs to be put into context. I believe that creating data visualizations, that are both aesthetically pleasing and informative, can communicate valuable messages to diverse audiences and make data accessible in a creative and enjoyable way. That's why I created "<a href="https://instagram.com/insert.data" target="_blank" class="lined">Insert Data</a>", where I regularly share my dataviz posts.
