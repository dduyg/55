      I recently built this website as an outlet to share things that I am working on. As someone with a curious mind, I often find myself exploring a wide range of topics, seeking to make hidden connections and gain new insights. Delving into different topics, ranging from the serious to the quirky are reflected in my mixed palette of blog posts. The posts can be easily filtered by project, tool/technique used (e.g. Python, Sentiment Analysis), or topic.
