     My name is Duygu, and I love creating impactful things using data and code. As a freelance data scientist, I help people with exploring the endless possibilities of data.

     <b style="color: #01868B; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace;">Data needs context, it needs to be humanized.</b>
     Data by itself is not meaningful unless it is placed within a broader context and presented in a way that makes sense to us. So, when working with clients, I focus on understanding the problem they are trying to solve and using data to craft a story that resonates with their audience. By first understanding the problem and context, we realize that data is not just strings and numbers; they represent something else - people, places, ideas, values. That is why my approach is based on providing data solutions that consider what the data stands for and what it means for the people who will interact with it.

     I enjoy experimenting with different technologies and techniques, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and expand my knowledge. If you have any questions or ideas for potential collaboration, please feel free to <a style="font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace;" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.contact-url }}" class="lined">contact</a> me.
