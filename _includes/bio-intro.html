- Conversations with open minded people are one of my favourite things.
     
- Data visualization and data storytelling has a special place in my heart. I am passionate about building creative visualizations to make insights more accessible. Created <a href="https://instagram.com/insert.data"> <i style="color: #0005FF;" class="instagram icon"></i>insert.data</a> where I share #dataviz posts.
            
- I love to research most random things, poking and prying with a purpose. You can find this back in my mixed pallet of blog posts.
      
- Besides data science, I also enjoy creating digital art. Especially glitch art and digital collage art. Did you know that even most of the images used on this website are my own creations?
