      Hello! Itâ€™s nice to meet you
     </div>
     <p>
     My name is <span style="color: #C0736B; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace;">Duygu</span>, and I love creating impactful things using data and code. 
     </p>

     <p>
      I am a freelance data scientist who works mainly remote. My work spans the entire process: wrangling raw data, data analysis, visual design, and production coding/development. With experience in various data analysis and machine learning techniques, I am able to bring ideas to life through data and code.  
     </p>
     <p>
     For data to become information, it needs to be put into context. I believe that creating data visualizations, that are both aesthetically pleasing and informative, can communicate valuable messages to diverse audiences and make data accessible in a creative and enjoyable way. That's why I created <a style="font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace;" href="https://instagram.com/insert.data" target="_blank" class="lined">Insert Data</a>, where I regularly share my dataviz posts.     
     </p>
     <p>
     I enjoy experimenting with different technologies and techniques, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and expand my knowledge. If you have any questions or ideas for potential collaboration, please feel free to <a style="font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace;" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.contact-url }}" class="lined">contact</a> me.
