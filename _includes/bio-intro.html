     My name is Duygu, and I love creating impactful things using data and code. As a freelance data scientist, I help people with exploring the endless possibilities of data.

     <span style="color: #458588; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace;" class="ui tiny header">Data needs context, it needs to be humanized:</span>
     Data by itself is not meaningful unless it is placed within a broader context and presented in a way that makes sense to us. So, when working with clients, I focus on understanding the problem they are trying to solve and using data to craft a story that resonates with their audience. 
    </p>
    <p>
     By first understanding the problem and context, we realize that data is not just strings and numbers; they represent something else - people, places, ideas, values. <span style="color: #A45A52;">That is why my approach is based on</span> providing data solutions that consider what the data stands for and what it means for the people who will interact with it. At the start of every engagement, I collaborate with clients to define their data maturity and understand their needs and goals. Based on their vision, I develop a customized project plan that transforms this vision into tangible results. Throughout the process, I work iteratively with built-in checkpoints to ensure that our efforts lead to the desired outcomes.
