      <p>Data needs context, it needs to be humanized. Data by itself is not meaningful unless it is placed within a broader context and presented in a way that makes sense to us. So, when working with clients, I focus on understanding the problem they are trying to solve and using data to craft a story that resonates with their audience. By <span style="color: #A45A52;">first understanding</span> the problem and context, we realize that data is not just strings and numbers; it represents something else - people, places, ideas, values.</p>
      <p>That is why <span style="color: #A45A52;">my approach is based on</span> providing data solutions that consider what the data stands for and what it means for the people who will interact with it. At the start of every engagement, I collaborate with clients to define their data maturity and understand their needs and goals. Based on their vision, I develop a customized project plan that transforms this vision <span style="color: #A45A52;">into tangible results</span>. Throughout the process, I work iteratively with built-in checkpoints to ensure that our efforts lead to the desired outcomes.</p>
