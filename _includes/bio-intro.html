     <span style="line-height: 1.5;" class="ui medium header">my name is Duygu, and it's great to meet you! I'm a data scientist with a flair for creativity. As a big fan of creating impactful things using data and code, I help people with exploring the endless possibilities of data.</span>

     <span style="color: #01868B; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace;" class="ui small header">Data needs context, it needs to be humanized:</span>
     Data by itself is not meaningful unless it is placed within a broader context and presented in a way that makes sense to us. So, when working with clients, I focus on understanding the problem they are trying to solve and using data to craft a story that resonates with their audience. By <span style="color: #A45A52;">first understanding</span> the problem and context, we realize that data is not just strings and numbers; it represents something else - people, places, ideas, values.
    </p>
    <p>     
     That is why <span style="color: #A45A52;">my approach is based on</span> providing data solutions that consider what the data stands for and what it means for the people who will interact with it. At the start of every engagement, I collaborate with clients to define their data maturity and understand their needs and goals. Based on their vision, I develop a customized project plan that transforms this vision <span style="color: #A45A52;">into tangible results</span>. Throughout the process, I work iteratively with built-in checkpoints to ensure that our efforts lead to the desired outcomes.
